Structuring a Next.js application for a simple task management application involves organizing your files in a way that follows best practices and makes your codebase easy to understand and maintain. Here's a suggested structure for your project:
    1. Pages:
        ◦ Next.js uses the pages directory for routing. Each file in the pages directory corresponds to a route in your application.
        ◦ Create the following files within the pages directory:
            ▪ index.tsx: This will be your main page displaying the tasks. You'll fetch data from your database (MySQL) and render the tasks here. You can also include buttons for adding new tasks, adjusting filters, and deleting tasks.
            ▪ add.tsx: This page will contain a form for adding new tasks. When the form is submitted, you'll handle the creation of the task and redirect back to the main page.
            ▪ filter.tsx: This page will contain UI elements for adjusting filters. When filters are adjusted, you'll update the URL query parameters and fetch filtered data from the database.
        ◦ Each page component should be a TypeScript file (.tsx) and export a React component.
    2. Components:
        ◦ Create a components directory to store reusable UI components.
        ◦ You might have components like TaskList, TaskItem, FilterButton, AddTaskForm, etc.
        ◦ These components can be imported and used in your page components.
    3. API Routes:
        ◦ Next.js allows you to create API routes in the pages/api directory.
        ◦ You can create API routes for handling CRUD operations on tasks (e.g., addTask, deleteTask, fetchTasks).
        ◦ These API routes will interact with your MySQL database to perform data operations.
    4. Database Interaction:
        ◦ Create a utils directory to store utility functions, including database interaction logic.
        ◦ You can create a module (e.g., db.ts) to encapsulate database operations using libraries like mysql or typeorm.
    5. Static Assets:
        ◦ If you have static assets like images or CSS files, you can store them in the public directory.
    6. Other Files:
        ◦ You can have other directories/files as needed, such as styles for global styles, constants for defining constants, etc.
Here's how your directory structure might look:

- pages
  - index.tsx
  - add.tsx
  - filter.tsx
- components
  - TaskList.tsx
  - TaskItem.tsx
  - FilterButton.tsx
  - AddTaskForm.tsx
- pages
  - api
    - addTask.ts
    - deleteTask.ts
    - fetchTasks.ts
- utils
  - db.ts
- public
  - ...
- styles
  - ...
- constants
  - …

Remember to install any necessary dependencies for database interaction, routing, and other functionalities using npm or yarn. Additionally, consider using TypeScript for type safety and better development experience.
This structure provides a clear separation of concerns and makes it easier to maintain and scale your application as it grows. Adjustments can be made based on your specific requirements and preferences.
